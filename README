Check out example.php to see how to use this in practice. 

This library is really just one function which will return a private key and a public address in an associated array.

Example result of calling bitcoin_address_pair():

Array
(
    [private] => KwFR8a14jDAX5V9N6yXNv9tsbMfJHgiWFgp9L3hTRF5K2kCuVwFB
    [public] => 1KzWzshpyzS4Udmr2RLLTaiMNtPTKTRewh
